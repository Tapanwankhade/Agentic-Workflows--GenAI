A Streamlit-native multi-modal AI workspace that combines utility tools with full agentic workflows for research, document intelligence, code generation, content creation, and support triage.

This project was built to feel like a single AI operations desk where users can move from raw input to structured output, rather than using disconnected one-off tools.

## Preview

![App Logo](static/logo.jpg)

The app includes a refreshed Streamlit dashboard with:

- light and dark theme support
- workspace switching for `Summarizer`, `Generator`, and `Assistant`
- dashboard cards and workflow summaries
- agentic flows with planning, validation, critique, and escalation logic

## Why This App

Most Streamlit GenAI demos stop at simple prompt-in / output-out experiences.

This application goes further by combining:

- classic AI utilities
- retrieval workflows
- agentic planning and review loops
- code verification
- confidence-based support routing

It is useful as:

- a portfolio project
- a productivity hub for AI experiments
- a foundation for internal copilots
- a base for document, research, and support automation

## Core Workspaces

The application is organized into three top-level workspaces.

### 1. Summarizer Workspace

Focused on condensing information from different media types.

Features:

- `Text Summarizer`
  - summarize raw text

## Agentic Workflows Included

This version contains five workflow-oriented modules:

1. `Research Agent`
2. `Document Intelligence`
3. `Code Copilot`
4. `Multimodal Content Pipeline`
5. `Support/Triage Agent`

Each one is built as more than just a generation call. Depending on the workflow, it may include:

- planning
- retrieval
- structured extraction
- verification
- critique
- revision
- confidence scoring
- escalation logic

## End-to-End Workflow Summary

### Research Agent

1. user enters a research topic
2. user provides source URLs
3. the agent creates a research plan
4. each source is read and summarized
5. a cited report is drafted
6. the report is critiqued and optionally revised

### Document Intelligence

1. user uploads files
2. text is extracted from PDF, DOCX, TXT, or images
3. the document is classified
4. entities are extracted
5. action items are generated

### Code Copilot

1. user enters a coding prompt
2. the agent generates code
3. code is verified locally using the available toolchain
4. if verification fails, a repair pass runs
5. verified code and a report are returned

### Content Pipeline

1. user enters a content idea
2. the pipeline creates a plan
3. it generates a script
4. it generates image prompts and platform captions
5. it reviews and refines the content package
6. it optionally creates narration audio

### Support/Triage Agent

1. user enters a support question
2. the request is classified by intent and severity
3. support URLs are processed
4. a grounded draft answer is created
5. confidence is scored
6. the request is answered or escalated

## UI / Frontend

The frontend is built entirely with Streamlit.

Notable UI improvements in the current version:

- custom dashboard-style landing area
- improved theme styling
- fixed dark mode toggle behavior
- segmented workspace navigation
- cleaner input, card, and expander styling
- better visual separation between workflow sections

No external frontend framework is used.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Agentic-Workflows-GenAI-.git
cd Agentic-Workflows-GenAI-
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure your API key

You can either:

- paste your OpenAI API key into the Streamlit sidebar at runtime
- or keep it locally in a `.env` file for personal development

Example:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Important:

- `.env` is ignored by git
- never commit secrets to GitHub

### 5. Optional local tools

Some features require local tooling:

- `Tesseract OCR`
  - needed for image OCR
  - expected default Windows path:
    - `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe`

- Code Copilot verification runtimes/compilers:
  - `python`
  - `node`
  - `javac`
  - `gcc`
  - `g++`

If one of these is missing, code generation can still work, but verification for that language may be unavailable.

### 6. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## What Was Improved In This Version

This repository now includes:

- stabilized app structure and cleaner git setup
- fixed function signature mismatches
- fixed in-memory uploaded file handling
- safer dependency handling
- updated OpenAI usage paths
- lazy loading for heavier local pipelines
- a verified multi-language Code Copilot
- five workflow-based AI modules
- a redesigned Streamlit frontend
- better theming and visual hierarchy

## Current Limitations

- live AI workflows require a valid OpenAI API key
- OCR quality depends on Tesseract installation and image quality
- article extraction depends on the structure of the target page
- some local fallback behaviors depend on available hardware and downloaded models
- research and support workflows currently rely on user-provided URLs rather than a persistent central knowledge base

## Recommended Next Improvements

- add persistent memory for documents and sources
- add export to PDF/Markdown for reports
- add unit/integration tests for workflow modules
- add persistent support knowledge base
- rename `init.py` files to proper `__init__.py`
- add deployment instructions for Streamlit Community Cloud or Render
- add dedicated screenshots/GIFs of the full UI
